Expected files   : mini_serv.c

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that will listen for client to connect on a certain port on 127.0.0.1 and will let clients to speak with each other

This program will take as first argument the port to bind to<br>
If no argument is given, it should write in stderr "Wrong number of arguments" followed by a \n and exit with status 1<br>
If a System Calls returns an error before the program start accepting connection, it should write in stderr "Fatal error" followed by a \n and exit with status 1<br>
If you cant allocate memory it should write in stderr "Fatal error" followed by a \n and exit with status 1<br>
<br>
Your program must be non-blocking but client can be lazy and if they don't read your message you must NOT disconnect them...<br>
<br>
Your program must not contains #define preproc<br>
Your program must only listen to 127.0.0.1<br>
The fd that you will receive will already be set to make 'recv' or 'send' to block if select hasn't be called before calling them, but will not block otherwise.<br>
<br>
When a client connect to the server:<br>
- the client will be given an id. the first client will receive the id 0 and each new client will received the last client id + 1<br>
- %d will be replace by this number<br>
- a message is sent to all the client that was connected to the server: "server: client %d just arrived\n"<br>
<br>
clients must be able to send messages to your program.<br>
- message will only be printable characters, no need to check<br>
- a single message can contains multiple \n<br>
- when the server receive a message, it must resend it to all the other client with "client %d: " before every line!<br>
<br>
When a client disconnect from the server:<br>
- a message is sent to all the client that was connected to the server: "server: client %d just left\n"<br>
<br>
Memory or fd leaks are forbidden<br>
<br>
To help you, you will find the file main.c with the beginning of a server and maybe some useful functions. (Beware this file use forbidden functions or write things that must not be there in your final program)<br>
<br>
Warning our tester is expecting that you send the messages as fast as you can. Don't do un-necessary buffer.<br>
<br>
Evaluation can be a bit longer than usual...<br>
<br>
Hint: you can use nc to test your program<br>
Hint: you should use nc to test your program<br>
Hint: To test you can use fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) but use select and NEVER check EAGAIN (man 2 send)<br>
